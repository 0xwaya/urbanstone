Public source repository for the Urban Stone Collective website, supplier content, and lead-sourcing automation.

## Overview

This repository contains the Urban Stone Collective project and its lead-sourcing automation. It keeps the deployable site, supplier tooling, and operational documentation together without unrelated workspace history.

The recovered project includes:

- the Urban Stone Collective marketing site
- a supplier scraper prototype for featured stone data
- a lead-sourcer utility for polling public sources and relaying matched leads through the existing webhook flow
- brand assets and countertop material imagery that were already committed in the source tree
- architecture and upgrade notes for future backend and automation work

## Safe Migration

This public repository was migrated with a safety-first protocol:

- only the committed Urban Stone project subtree was retained
- unrelated monorepo history was not pushed
- generated scraper output was removed from tracked source
- obvious secret patterns were scanned before publish
- environment files, local caches, build artifacts, and editor noise are ignored by default

See MIGRATION_NOTES.md for the migration boundary and follow-up guidance.

## Current Status

This repository now includes a runnable standalone frontend baseline, but it still needs a real lead-delivery destination and fuller operational rollout before it should be treated as a finished production property.

What is present:

- the primary landing page entry under `frontend/pages/index.jsx`
- a standalone `frontend/package.json` and generated lockfile for the site
- reusable marketing components for navigation, feature highlights, lead capture, hero, and supplier sections
- a gated contractor portal with magic-link login, session cookie protection, and Supabase-backed access control
- a trimmed contractor pricing page with expandable material cards and direct sales contact actions
- static brand and supplier material assets
- the supplier scraper prototype and source list
- Tailwind, ESLint, Vitest, Docker, and GitHub Actions CI for the frontend
- baseline runtime hardening for the site and lead endpoint, including security headers, same-origin checks, payload validation, a honeypot, and rate limiting

What is still missing or incomplete:

- a real CRM, email, or webhook destination behind `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- production env configuration for contractor access and mail delivery (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CONTRACTOR_SESSION_SECRET`, `CONTRACTOR_ADMIN_EMAILS`, optional `CONTRACTOR_APPROVED_EMAILS`, `RESEND_API_KEY`)
- image optimization work if you want to replace the current flexible `img` usage with `next/image`
- broader production concerns such as analytics, uptime monitoring, content workflow, and end-to-end browser tests

That means the repository is now suitable for local development, CI validation, and staged deployment prep, but it still should not be presented as a finished production application until lead delivery and operational ownership are wired through.

## Security

Basic repository hygiene already applied:

- secret-pattern scan completed before migration
- generated output removed from tracked source
- repo-level ignore rules added for env files, logs, and build artifacts
- public disclosure guidance documented in SECURITY.md

If you discover a security issue or accidental sensitive disclosure, follow SECURITY.md instead of opening a public issue.

## Working With The Snapshot

### Frontend

The frontend is now a standalone Next.js pages app with Tailwind, tests, CI, and a hardened lead intake route.

Local workflow:

1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env.local`
4. set `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL` to the system that should receive quote requests
5. `npm run dev`

Contractor portal setup:

- protected route: `/contractors`
- public gate: `/contractors/login`
- admins listed in `CONTRACTOR_ADMIN_EMAILS` can request a magic link without manual approval
- pre-vetted contractors can be listed in `CONTRACTOR_APPROVED_EMAILS`
- all other contractor applicants are inserted into Supabase with `approved=false` until manually approved
- direct contractor inquiries now route to email/text from inside the portal instead of the residential estimate form
- contractor pricing email preview can be sent with `npm run contractor:email:preview`

The frontend now includes a mobile-spacing pass for the live landing page, including the quote card, hero layout, and supplier browsing flow.

Recent supplier-browser updates in the frontend include:

- compact supplier cards that keep the homepage focused on Urban Stone as the primary contact
- curated slab previews lazy-loaded behind supplier-specific shortlist actions
- collapsible location and hours controls with a tighter single-card mobile layout
- section-level handoff copy and CTA blocks that route visitors back to estimate and contact actions
- softened supplier logo treatments and tighter card styling so the materials library stays inside the main brand system
- extra anchor scroll offset and lighter sticky-header padding for cleaner mobile jumps into the materials section
- contractor portal entry moved off the homepage body and into the mobile hamburger menu plus footer CTAs
- contractor pricing now uses compact expandable material previews for faster visual scanning

Quality gates:

1. `npm run lint`
2. `npm run test`
3. `npm run build`

Deployment options currently included:

1. GitHub Actions CI via `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`
2. container deployment via `frontend/Dockerfile`
3. standalone Next.js output for process-based hosting

Production note:

- the standalone Next.js server requires `sharp` to be installed because the site uses Next image optimization in production
- if you deploy on Vercel, keep the project Root Directory set to `frontend`
- if you deploy via a process manager, run the install in `frontend`, build there, and start with `node .next/standalone/server.js` from that same directory so the standalone server can resolve its runtime dependencies
- the contractor portal depends on a working Supabase project and Resend key in production; without those env vars, registration and magic-link delivery will not function

For Vercel, the cleanest setup is to set the project Root Directory to `frontend` in the dashboard because that is where the Next.js app and lockfile live.

Lead webhook payload note:

- `frontend/pages/api/lead.js` now forwards correlation metadata for downstream automation and debugging.
- `metadata.requestId` is propagated from inbound `x-request-id` when available, otherwise generated server-side.
- `metadata.dedupeKey` is generated as a deterministic hash from normalized lead fields so Zapier/Storage duplicate suppression can use a stable key.

### Zapier Pipeline

Urban Stone production lead intake zap is published and live with the following configuration:

- Zap ID: `357570886`
- Architecture: 6-step dedup suppression + email routing

The Zapier zap that receives leads from the webhook and forwards them to Outlook uses this step order:

|Step|App|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|1|Webhooks by Zapier — Catch Hook|Receives the inbound lead payload|
|2|Filter by Zapier|Current live intake gate: continue only if `lead.email` and `lead.phone` exist|
|3|Storage by Zapier — Get Value|Initial dedup read on the `urban-stone-dedupe` key|
|4|Filter by Zapier|Duplicate check: continue only if no dedup value is found|
|5|Storage by Zapier — Set Value|**Write** key `dedup::{{source}}::{{lead__email}}` = `1` to mark lead as processed|
|6|Microsoft Outlook — Send Email|Forward formatted lead to the sales inbox|

**Critical:** Step 5 (Storage Set Value) must come before Outlook. Without it, the filter at Step 4 passes every submission because the key is never written — making Zapier-side dedup non-functional.

Current live storage key pattern: `dedup::{{source}}::{{lead__email}}`

Current live dedup behavior: suppresses duplicate email sends for repeated submissions from the same source and email address (24h window in Zapier configuration).

Current website payload contract:

- `submittedAt`, `source`, `requestId`, `dedupeKey`, `routeId`, `automated`
- `lead.{name, email, phone, projectDetails, ...}`
- `metadata.{dedupeKey, automated, routeId, requestId, ip, userAgent, referer}`

Outlook email subject template: `New Lead — {{source}} — {{name}} ({{routeId}})`

Validation check:

- Send 1 with a new source + email pair: all 6 steps execute and Outlook sends.
- Send 2 with the same source + email pair: flow stops at Step 4 and Outlook is skipped.

Post-deploy upgrade path:

- After a fresh webhook sample exposes `dedupeKey` and `automated` in Zapier's trigger field picker, switch the Storage Get/Set key from `dedup::{{source}}::{{lead__email}}` to `dedup::{{dedupeKey}}` with `metadata__dedupeKey` fallback.
- At the same time, widen the intake filter to continue when `(lead.email exists AND lead.phone exists) OR (automated = true OR metadata.automated = true)` so automated lead-sourcer payloads can share the same Zap safely.

Deferred Zapier hardening backlog (optional, for later implementation):

- add a source guard filter before Outlook to suppress internal `wire-test` events
- include `source`, `routeId`, and classifier score (when present) in the Outlook subject/body for triage
- add a low-volume alert path (for example Slack or digest email) when no accepted leads arrive in a configured window
- make dedupe retention/TTL policy explicit in Zapier Storage operations for predictable replay behavior

The code-side dedup guard in `frontend/pages/api/lead.js` provides within-session protection (1-hour TTL, in-memory). The Zapier Storage layer provides persistent cross-session protection.

### Supplier Scraper

The supplier scraper is a small Node.js prototype using Cheerio.

Typical workflow:

1. install dependencies in `supplier-scraper`
2. run the scraper locally
3. review results manually before publishing any supplier-derived content

Do not commit generated scraper output unless it is intentionally reviewed and treated as a versioned artifact.

### Lead Sourcer

The lead sourcer is a standalone Node.js utility under `lead-sourcer` that polls Reddit, Craigslist, and Apify tasks, classifies posts against countertop/remodel intent, deduplicates matches, and relays qualified leads to the configured webhook.

Manual workflow:

1. `cd lead-sourcer`
2. create `lead-sourcer/.env` with `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL=...`
3. add source integration env entries:

- required: `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL=...`
- optional Apify: `APIFY_TOKEN=...`
- optional Apify task IDs: `APIFY_NEXTDOOR_TASK_ID=...`, `APIFY_FACEBOOK_TASK_ID=...`, `APIFY_AD_LIBRARY_TASK_ID=...`

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run run`

Direct source runs:

- `npm run poll:reddit`
- `npm run poll:craigslist`
- `npm run poll:apify`
You can also invoke the wrapper directly with `bash lead-sourcer/run.sh` from the repository root.

Each direct poll command now honors `LEAD_SOURCER_MODE` and `--mode=` (for example: `LEAD_SOURCER_MODE=dry-run npm run poll:reddit`).

Scheduler and run-observability controls (implemented in `lead-sourcer/src/index.js`):

- `LEAD_SOURCER_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default: `0`) — set `>0` to run poll cycles continuously on interval
- `LEAD_SOURCER_MAX_CYCLES` (default: `0`) — optional max cycles in interval mode (`0` = unbounded)
- `LEAD_SOURCER_RUN_LOG_FILE` (default: `lead-sourcer/runs/poll-runs.jsonl`) — JSONL summaries per cycle
- `LEAD_SOURCER_ZERO_MATCH_ALERT_THRESHOLD` (default: `0`) — warn after N consecutive zero-match cycles
- `LEAD_SOURCER_SUMMARY_WINDOW_HOURS` (default: `24`) — reporting window for daily summary script
- `LEAD_SOURCER_TRACING_ENABLED` (default: `true`) — enable OpenTelemetry tracing export
- `LEAD_SOURCER_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` (default: `lead-sourcer`) — service name in traces
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` (default: `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`) — OTLP HTTP traces endpoint

Examples:

- one-shot (default): `npm run run`
- every 15 minutes: `LEAD_SOURCER_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15 npm run run`
- every 15 minutes, stop after 8 cycles: `LEAD_SOURCER_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15 LEAD_SOURCER_MAX_CYCLES=8 npm run run`

Monitoring script:

- `npm run summary:daily` — prints last-window run totals and zero-match streak from `runs/poll-runs.jsonl`
- exits with code `2` when zero-match streak meets `LEAD_SOURCER_ZERO_MATCH_ALERT_THRESHOLD`
- `npm run summary:weekly-tuning` — summarizes near-miss/review queues for threshold tuning
- set `LEAD_SOURCER_TUNING_WINDOW_DAYS` (default `7`) to tune the weekly summary window

Tracing:

- open the local collector/viewer in VS Code with command `AI Toolkit: Open Trace Viewer`
- run `bash lead-sourcer/run.sh` (or existing npm scripts) and traces are emitted automatically
- set `LEAD_SOURCER_TRACING_ENABLED=false` to disable tracing for a run

Run modes (set via `--mode=` CLI flag or `LEAD_SOURCER_MODE` env var):

- `live` (default): relay matches + persist seen IDs
- `dry-run`: classify and log without relaying or persisting
- `review-only`: persist seen IDs and log borderline candidates to `runs/review-candidates.jsonl`, no relay

Classification verdicts:

- `match`: direct keyword + intent signal — relayed in live mode
- `borderline`: material/context signal without clear intent — logged to `runs/review-candidates.jsonl`; can also relay in live mode when recall-first controls are enabled
- `reject`: excluded noise terms or no relevant signal

Operational notes:

- `lead-sourcer/run.sh` is the saved entrypoint for manual runs and any future scheduler wiring
- `lead-sourcer/.env` and `lead-sourcer/seen-ids.json` are intentionally gitignored runtime files
- the current poller is intended for manual execution until the OpenClaw gateway issue is resolved
- Craigslist RSS returns 403; the poller uses HTML search parsing (`cl-static-search-result`) instead
- Reddit polling combines subreddit `/new` with targeted search queries against r/cincinnati
- geo-aware queries are auto-generated from `frontend/data/service-areas.js` city data at runtime
- filter strength targets material + region combinations including `granite countertops`, `quartz countertops`, and `quartzite countertops`
- Craigslist query volume is capped via `LEAD_SOURCER_CRAIGSLIST_QUERY_LIMIT` (default: 120) to keep runs bounded
- Apify source is enabled when `APIFY_TOKEN` and at least one task ID are present; otherwise it is skipped without failing the run
- Apify stability controls:
  - `APIFY_ENABLE_NEXTDOOR=true|false`
  - `APIFY_ENABLE_FACEBOOK=true|false`
  - `APIFY_ENABLE_AD_LIBRARY=true|false`
  - `APIFY_OVERRIDE_TASK_INPUT=true|false` (default: `false`)
    - `false` (recommended): uses saved input from each Apify task in Apify Console
    - `true`: forces runtime overrides from `APIFY_*_TASK_INPUT` JSON env values
  - `APIFY_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default: `120000`)
  - `APIFY_TASK_DELAY_MS` (default: `1200`)
  - common troubleshooting:
    - if logs show `fetched > 0` and `skippedSeen == fetched`, the task is returning previously seen posts (dedupe is working as designed)
    - if Facebook task output looks unrelated (example: `humansofnewyork`), reconfigure the Apify task `startUrls` in Apify Console
    - if Nextdoor returns zero items repeatedly, validate task `locations` in Apify Console and account/session health
- one-time Reddit recency expansion controls:
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_FIRST_RUN_EXTENDED_WINDOW=true|false` (default: `true`)
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_FIRST_RUN_MAX_POST_AGE_HOURS=336` (default: 14 days)
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_FIRST_RUN_MARKER_FILE=/custom/path.flag` (optional)
- run-report relay control:
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_SEND_RUN_REPORT=true|false` (default: `true`)
  - every live cycle emits a run-report payload (including zero-match cycles)
- Reddit regional gate control:
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_REQUIRE_REGIONAL_SIGNAL=true|false` (default: `true`)
  - set to `false` to allow non-r/cincinnati high-intent matches during growth/tuning windows
- recall-first relay controls:
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_RELAY_BORDERLINE=true|false` (default: `true`)
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_BORDERLINE_RELAY_MIN_SCORE=35` (default: `35`)
  - use these to relay higher-signal borderline candidates while preserving manual review logs
- automated relays include `lead.externalPostId`, `lead.externalPostUrl`, and enriched metadata for Zap triage: `metadata.automated=true`, `metadata.dedupeKey`, `metadata.requestId`, `metadata.verdict`, `metadata.score`, `metadata.scoreBand`, `metadata.hasAnchor`, and `metadata.signalFactors`

Current runtime state (April 10, 2026):

- lead-sourcer tests are passing (`35/35`)
- OpenTelemetry tracing is integrated in `lead-sourcer/src/tracing.js` and initialized at startup from `lead-sourcer/src/index.js`
- tracing default endpoint is `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` and works with AI Toolkit Trace Viewer
- run-report payloads now include both plain text (`lead.projectDetails`) and HTML (`lead.htmlReport`) so downstream automation can render a chart-style digest email
- live runs continue to relay run reports successfully (`HTTP 200`) even on zero-match cycles
- current no-individual-email behavior is still expected when recent cycles classify `0 match` leads (dedupe and filters working as designed)

Safe-stop update (April 10, 2026):

- recall-first backend changes remain active on `main` (commit: `c113503`)
- tracing dependencies were added to `lead-sourcer/package.json` and lockfile for reproducible local runs
- a tracing bootstrap smoke test completed successfully and logs: `OpenTelemetry enabled (service=lead-sourcer, endpoint=http://localhost:4318/v1/traces)`
- run-report relay remains healthy with `HTTP 200` responses after recent reporting-format updates

Vercel cron integration (every 4 hours):

- `frontend/vercel.json` schedules `0 */4 * * *` for `/api/cron/lead-sourcer`
- `frontend/pages/api/cron/lead-sourcer.js` is a secure trigger endpoint
- required Vercel env vars:
  - `CRON_SECRET` (Vercel cron auth)
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_TRIGGER_URL` (your runner endpoint that actually executes `lead-sourcer`)
- optional Vercel env var:
  - `LEAD_SOURCER_TRIGGER_SECRET` (bearer token sent to runner endpoint)

Next session pickup checklist:

1. Trigger one additional automated test with `metadata.scoreBand=tepid` to verify Path B end-to-end.
2. Validate duplicate suppression by sending the same `metadata.dedupeKey` twice and confirming second send is blocked.
3. Run one normal live cycle and inspect Zap run history distribution across Path A, Path B, and fallback.
4. If fallback share is high, inspect incoming webhook samples and tighten path predicates only after confirming field presence.

## Roadmap

Short-term:

- connect the lead endpoint to a production CRM or webhook
- replace placeholder or stale supplier data with reviewed content
- decide whether to keep raw `img` flexibility or move the gallery to `next/image`

Medium-term:

- add structured content management
- define backend and lead-capture architecture
- harden deployment, analytics, and SEO

Long-term:

- production launch with clear operational ownership, CI, and release workflow
